# Error and warning messages

---

</div>

<div align="left">

When the compiler finds an error in a file, it outputs a message giving, in this order:

- the name of the file

- the line number were the compiler detected the error between parentheses, directly behind the filename

- the error class (“error”, “fatal error” or “warning”)

- an error number

- a descriptive error message

For example:

    demo.p(3) : error 001: expected token: ";", but found "{"

Note: the line number given by the compiler may specify a position behind the
actual error, since the compiler cannot always establish an error before having
analyzed the complete expression.

After termination, the return code of the compiler is:

    0   no errors —there may be warnings, though
    1   errors found
    2   reserved
    3   aborted by user

These return codes may be checked within batch processors (such as the “make” utility).

### • Error categories

Errors are separated into three classes:

| Type         | Description                                                                                                                                 |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Errors       | Describe situations where the compiler is unable to generate appropriate code. Errors messages are numbered from 1 to 99.                   |
| Fatal errors | Fatal errors describe errors from which the compiler cannot recover. Parsing is aborted. Fatal error messages are numbered from 100 to 199. |
| Warnings     | Warnings are displayed for unintended compiler assumptions and common mistakes. Warning messages are numbered from 200 to 299.              |

### • Errors

This message indicates that prior to the declaration of the user-defined operator, an instance where the operator was used on operands with the same tags occurred. This may either indicate that the program tries to make mixed use of the default operator and a user-defined operator (which is unsupported), or that the user-defined operator must be “forwardly declared”. |

|        | An internal table in the pawn parser is too small to hold the required data. Some tables are dynamically growable, which means that there was insufficient memory to resize the table. The “table name” is one of the following:                                                                                                      |
|        | “staging buffer”: the staging buffer holds the code generated for an expression before it is passed to the peephole optimizer. The staging buffer grows dynamically, so an overflow of the staging buffer basically is an “out of memory” error.                                                                                      |
|        | “loop table”: the loop table is a stack used with nested do, for, and while statements. The table allows nesting of these statements up to 24 levels.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|        | “literal table”: this table keeps the literal constants (numbers, strings) that are used in expressions and as initiallers for arrays. The literal table grows dynamically, so an overflow of the literal table basically is an “out of memory” error.                                                                                |
|        | “compiler stack”: the compiler uses a stack to store temporary information it needs while parsing. An overflow of this stack is probably caused by deeply nested (or recursive) file inclusion. The compiler stack grows dynamically, so an overflow of the compiler stack basically is an “out of memory” error.                     |

|        | When a function is “used” (invoked) before being declared, and that function returns a value with a tag name, the parser must make an extra pass over the source code, because the presence of the tag name may change the interpretation of operators (in the presence of user-defined operators). You can speed up the parsing/compilation process by declaring the relevant functions before using them.    |

|        | A local variable has the same name as a global variable, a function, a function argument, or a local variable at a lower precedence level. This is called “shadowing”, as the new local variable makes the previously defined function or variable inaccessible.                                                                                                                                               |
|        | Note: if there are also error messages further on in the script about missing variables (with these same names) or brace level problems, it could well be that the shadowing warnings are due to these syntactical and sematical errors.

|        | There is a statement like “x = x” in the code. The parser checks for self assignments after performing any text and constant substitutions, so the left and right sides of an assignment may appear to be different at first sight. For example, if the symbol “TWO” is a constant with the value 2, then “var[TWO] = var[2]” is also a self-assignment.                                                       |
|        | Self-assignments are, of course, redundant, and they may hide an error (assignment to the wrong variable, error in declaring constants).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

|        | When indexing an array, the expression used as the index has a different tag than what the one in the declaration of the array. See pages 29 and 68 for an explanation and examples.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

|        | A function is lacking an implementation for the indicated state. The compiler cannot (statically) check whether the function will ever be called in that state, and therefore it issues this warning. When the function would be called for the state for which no implementation exists, the abstract machine aborts with a run time error.                                                                   |

|        | Compact encoding may in some particular cases result in files that would actually be bigger than the non-compact encoding. The abstract machine cannot handle this, as it unpacks the P-code “in place”. When the compiler deticts this situation, it re-builds the file with compact encoding switched off. To avoid this warning, force building the file with plain (“non-compact”) encoding —see page 120. |

|        | The state variable has the same name as a global variable (without state specifiers). This means that the global variable is inaccessible for a function with one of the same states as those of the variable.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
